Select the one that closely meets your business needs; check the eligibility and annual charges. Set Spending Limits Establish clear guidelines for card usage within your organisation. Define which expenses are allowed and set spending limits for employees if necessary.Track Transactions Regularly Keep a close eye on your card transactions through HDFC Bank’s online banking channels to identify unauthorised or unusual transactions. Pay the Full Balance on Time Avoid interest charges by paying your Credit Card bill in full before the due date. Ensure a positive credit history and avoid debt accumulation. Maximise Savings With Rewards You can take advantage of reward points and cashback and save more on your spends. For instance, you can redeem your reward points into airmiles and get discounted airfare for business travel. Take Advantage of Interest-Free Period Time your purchases after the Credit Card bill generation date to make use of the full interest-free period. Familiarise Yourself With the Card’s Terms and Charges Read the terms and conditions of your Business Credit Card, including interest rates, fees, and any applicable penalties. Being cognizant of these details helps you avoid unexpected costs. Consider Automating Payments Set up automatic payments to ensure that you never miss a due date. This way, you can avoid late payment fees and potential impact on credit score. Review Your Credit Report from Time to Time Check your business credit report regularly to address any discrepancies promptly. Monitoring your credit helps you identify and correct any issues that may affect your creditworthiness. FAQsWhat is a Business Credit Card?A Business Credit Card is a financial tool designed for business expenses. Like a regular Credit Card, you can make purchases and pay for those purchases later in the form of Credit Card bills. Business Credit Cards provide a convenient way for businesses to manage their expenses, make purchases, and separate business transactions from personal finances. Who is eligible for a Business Credit Card?​​​​​​​Businesses, self-employed individuals, etc., can apply for a Business Credit Card provided they fulfil the card issuer’s eligibility criteria. How to apply for a Business Credit Card?You can apply for a Business Credit Card online on the card issuer’s website. For HDFC Bank’s Business Credit Card, you can get started here. Choose the Credit Card variant and fill out the online application form or connect with customer support. What is the credit limit on a Business Credit Card? The credit limit on a Business Credit Card can vary widely depending on several factors, including the financial health of the business, the business owner's credit history, and the card issuer's policies. Can I use a Business Credit Card for personal expenses?Typically, using a Business Credit Card for personal expenses is not recommended. For instance, combining personal and business expenses may make it difficult to report business-related expenses for tax purposes. Make sure you check the terms and conditions of your specific Credit Card agreement.
